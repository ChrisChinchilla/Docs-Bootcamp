## Reviewing content

Spell check and grammar check, inbuilt, plugin, or external services. Useful tools:

-   Most text editors have spell checking
-   Linters (write-good)
-   Grammarly
-   Hunspell / aspell
-   Maybe (blog posts etc) might benefit from readability checkers (Hemingway, readability).

Peer review and editing if possible, preferably from outside the project. Peer review on version control, google docs, wikis, print and write.
