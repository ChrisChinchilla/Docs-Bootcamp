# The mechanics of writing

Before you start use your application to accomplish tasks, and understand how to use your own product and problems people might have, ideally get others to use it too.

## Headings and subheadings

Write standalone headings to ensure search results are easy to differentiate. For example, don’t use the same single-verb heading in different sections (adding, integrating, compiling, testing…); they might all appear in a list of search results.

Examples: Install, configure, set, compile, start, scale, etc…

Save questions for task areas and troubleshooting guides - they are the most “actionable” type.

## Page structure

Keep it short and in easy to parse ‘chunks’; this doesn’t mean you have to refrain from covering all the details, but do break it out into easier-to-scan sections.

Follow standard good practices of HTML page structure, headings weight, good use of formatting etc, alt tags on images etc (find a reference).

Keep in mind that the reader may be impatient; make it easy for the reader to scan content for things like images and code snippets; make it easy for them to absorb need-to-know information.

No long paragraphs or sentences; include plenty of lists (when necessary and appropriate i.e. numbered for steps, bullets for general lists), signposts in the form of headings,

## Tone

Stick to what is necessary; cut out colloquialisms, repetition, and ‘weasel’ words (there are tools to help).

If there is a company style guide, use it! If there isn’t, use a common one, add to it, or write your own, and add anything that is important to you.

Stay gender neutral or ‘be fair’.

Using the right level of humour / wink in the right places (Atlassian presentation or others)

Be consistent!

## Grammar

Use consistent voice and tense, good English grammar, etc.

Avoid passive voice as much as possible, unless the removal of it complicates the explanation (bear in mind non-native speakers).

Separate actor and subject and keep in mind that actors and subjects may sometimes be non-persons, e.g., systems, machines, API calls, methods, etc.

Be consistent!

## Media

With all media, supplement text, not replace and provide text alternatives.

Use images, screenshots and video (with or without audio) when it helps explain something better than words do, or that clarify ambiguity. Bear in mind that they can be harder to change, maintain and translate, and other formats print, mobile, accessibility, internet connections etc.

Audio may help for those with visual impairments and learning difficulties.

## Examples

-   UNIX man pages for reference content and to educate about the use of placeholders in code syntax (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page>), Clarify what a reader needs to replace and use formatting or highlighting to indicate it.
-   Base examples on ‘real world’ use cases if you have any, or intended users.
-   Use examples that work, ideally together with other examples in the documentation.
-   Consider supplying the example(s) as downloads.
-   Test your examples work.
-   Avoid destructive examples or leaking ‘secrets’.
-   Many points of the above on voice, humour etc apply.
-   Consistency of examples and refer to how people can find earlier examples if necessary.
