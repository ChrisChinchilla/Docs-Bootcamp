## Maintenance

If a feature you’ve documented changes, the docs need to change too. This could happen for several reasons, including bug fixes, enhancements, and updates. It’s not uncommon for software that interacts with third parties to require updating, as problems and workarounds emerge.

Maintaining is simple and likely the same as the ways you maintain your code. Version control, pull requests etc.

Especially, remember those screenshots.

## Future proofing

We won't cover in detail here, but consider how to make maintaining docs in the future easier, such as content reuse, separating content, constantly changing features etc.
