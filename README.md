# Overview

This repository contains notes, ideas and resources for training new developers in better documentation practices.

The content is intended to be delivered as a module (or series) as part of a developer bootcamp, likely lasting half a day. But feel free to make pull requests or suggestions for longer or shorter versions of the content.

## Target Audience

The target for this content is newly trained developers or experienced developers looking to gain new skills. Currently we aim to test the content with the Le Wagon developer bootcamp, but open an issue and let us know if you plan to use it elsewhere.

## Work in Progress

Most of the content here is still work in progress stubs after a documentation hackathon at the 2017 Write the Docs conference in Prague.
