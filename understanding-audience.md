# Understanding your audience

If you don’t understand who your users are or what they need from your docs, you can’t write the right thing.

Docs designed around users and their needs:

-   are more likely to be used
-   help more people get the right outcome for them - and so achieve their intent
-   cost less to run by reducing time and money spent on resolving problems
-   marketing communication versus technical communication

You should:

-   Avoid making assumptions about user’s background and experience level. But do research who your users are. You may be able to reference user research from product management, etc.
-   Avoid making the assumption the reader’s first language is the one you’re writing in.
-   Write simply
-   Avoid idiomatic language

Understand the context your user is in:

-   what are they’re trying to do, eg. ops engineer fixing issue on call at 4 in the morning
-   how they currently do it (for example, what services or tools they use)
-   the problems or frustrations they experience
-   what users need from your docs to achieve their goal

Speak the language of your user.

-   Terminology
-   Mindset
-   Skill level

User stories and test scenarios for docs can be helpful. Collaborate with product manager/product support/customer service team/designers/translators. Make friends with people who can help you!
