# Introduction

-   Identifying the importance of writing documentation at all
-   It’s hard, but relax
-   MVP docs - it just needs to meet basic needs, anything extra is a bonus - “perfection is poison”
-   Communicating through supporting content
-   Supplementing the UI/product/service
-   Docs will be linked from marketing material, need to be found by Google
-   Transfer knowledge
-   Legal requirements
-   ‘Docs or it didn’t happen’
-   Saves your time + money (don’t need to pay devs/consultants/support engineers to answer questions)
-   Uncovers your own misunderstanding/flaws (another means of testing)
-   Naming is hard - do the hard work early
-   Can be design tool (esp. API docs)
-   Be proactive in gathering information
-   Expect edits!

## What we mean when we say documentation

-   Content that explains (translates into human)
-   Used to guide, train, troubleshoot
-   A  major role in shaping a delightful user experience with built-in flexibility.

Documentation ranges from user interface texts (e.g. field labels, messages, button text) over all sorts of embedded information (e.g. mouseovers, wizards, overlays, videos) to separate, self-contained deliverables (e.g. user or developer guides). It can include API docs, READMEs, error messages, CLI tools, tests, code comments.

## Tasks

“How do I …”
Prerequisites, steps, results

## Reference

API docs
Error messages
Things people need for a specific issue or problem

## Concepts

“What is …”
“How does …”
Overviews and explainers

## Mediums / Methods

4 main types

( The four kinds of documentation, and why you need to understand what they are - Daniele Procida - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_1A5FXVP4s> )

For example, a tutorial or readme might begin with the explanation of a concept, followed by tasks and optional references for further information.

A CLI tool might be used to accomplish a task but will introduce concepts and references.

UI text accomplish a task, accompanied by concepts and reference.

EXTERNAL RESOURCE

“Just write!”: Write down everything you know and then edit and refine. Then, break out into tasks, references, and concepts.
